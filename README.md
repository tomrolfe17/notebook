# Notebook

Notebook is a text editor application built using the python tkinter library for usage on Mac OS.

It currently only supports very basic editing and saving facilities. I am looking to add more features including a status bar to display information about the contents of the editor including cursor position and line numbering as well as the standard menus such as edit and format.
